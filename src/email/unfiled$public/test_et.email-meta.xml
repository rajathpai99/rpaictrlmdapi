    <textOnly>Hi &lt;account team&gt;,


It&apos;s hard to believe, but it has been 6 months since we hosted the  Executive Engagement, and we’d like to check back in to see if you’ve had any wins.


&quot;Wins&quot; can be anything from an increase in revenue, a new deal or test, a pivotal meeting, or even just a piece of positive feedback you heard from your client, but please make sure they are quantified (ex: “upped YouTube budget by $5M for Q4, which is a 50% increase over Q3”,  vs. “increased budget”). You can have a look at our Q3 &apos;20 Quarterly Report for examples of the types of wins we are looking for. Updated.</textOnly>
